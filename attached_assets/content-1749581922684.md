Are you a professional truck driver ready to leverage your knowledge and hard work to take control of your schedule and pay?

A CDL is a valuable asset, and there's a reason so many trucking companies compete for the privilege of you driving for them, especially if you're looking to become an owner-operator.

If you own your own truck but are using someone else's authority, this is an even bigger win for the company owner, who lets you handle all the major expenses but typically keeps between 10 to 40% of your earnings.

If paperwork and compliance management have kept you from taking the leap to real independence and taking full control of your company, CarrierForge can eliminate these obstacles and help you start a trucking business with confidence.

![Owner Operators](https://carrierforge.com/images/content/owner-operators/owner-operator-1.jpg)

We make the process simple by providing a personalized list of recommended and required steps based on your specific equipment, location, and operations. This guidance will show you how to get a trucking authority quickly so you can become an owner-operator without the headaches.

With our trucking authority services, you can get your authority fast, efficiently, and affordably transition into the world of an owner-operator startup. Let us help you navigate your trucking business startup and achieve your dreams of independence!
