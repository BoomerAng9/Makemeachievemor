A. Company‑Side Flow & Verification

Step	Actor	Trigger	System checks	Next state	Notices sent
1	Company rep	Sign‑up	‑ Email domain ≠ public provider‑ Logo uploaded‑ Rep photo + phone added	pending‑verification	“Thanks, we’re checking your details.”
2	Admin	Approve	Domain ⇄ company name match	active	• Email to rep “Account live.”• Welcome chat thread opened
3	Company	Post Load / Service Request	Plan tier ≥ minimum feature?	open	Load card appears to drivers
4	Driver	Accept	—	requested	Admin + company pinged
5	Admin	Verify & Assign	Docs, insurance etc.	assigned	Pickup details to driver; confirm to company
6	Driver	Picked Up → Delivered	—	delivered	Company gets live ETA + proof‑of‑delivery
7	Admin	Mark Paid	Payment confirmed	closed	Invoice PDF to company; earnings to driver

Small webhooks (Resend email + Twilio SMS) fire on each state so nobody misses a beat.

Standard	$29.99	$199	Growing carriers (1‑5 trucks)	Unlimited job posts • 3 active loads • Basic AI insights • Glove Box 2 GB
Professional	$59.99	$399	Regional fleets (6‑15 units)	10 active loads • Route analytics • Compliance alerts • Multi‑user dashboard

Benchmark: Competitors charge a monthly fee after their setup fee as well, but is mainly for hosting; our bands add real‑time dispatch, AI tips, and payment rails, so the value is seen on going and considerately more.

D. Naming the Broader “On‑Call” Offering

A few tight options that hint at instant dispatch across ANY field service:

Option	Rationale
QuickDeploy Network by: ACHIEVEMOR	Straight to the point—fast assignments, wide verticals.
ServeSprint Hub by: ACHIEVEMOR	Covers delivery, caregiving, catering—anything “service + speed”.
FlexRoute Exchange by: ACHIEVEMOR	Highlights adaptable routing beyond freight.
RapidReach Platform by: ACHIEVEMOR	Implies on‑demand reach for goods and people.
InstantCrew Portal by: ACHIEVEMOR	Focus on matching crews/drivers/helpers on the fly.

Pick the one that feels most on‑brand; all work nicely in the new landing‑page heading:

InstantCrew Portal
On‑call deployment for freight, food, care & ride services.

E. Quick Checks to Tighten UX
	•	Add logo & doc uploader right in signup flow (no second page).
	•	Auto‑reject non‑corporate emails with inline hint: “Please use a company domain (e.g., @yourbiz.com).”
	•	Tier upsell banner when a company hits its active‑load limit.
	•	Share‑to‑social toggle after each successful delivery (LinkedIn badge).
	•	Mobile‑first cards, 44 px tap targets.

Copy this spec to your Replit repo; it plugs into the same state machine you’ve already built for drivers.
