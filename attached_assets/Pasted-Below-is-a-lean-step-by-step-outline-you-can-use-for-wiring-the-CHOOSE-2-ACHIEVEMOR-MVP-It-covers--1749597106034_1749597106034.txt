Below is a lean, step‑by‑step outline you can use for wiring the CHOOSE 2 ACHIEVEMOR MVP. It covers data objects, status changes, and the visible UI cues a driver or company will see.

1. Core Objects

// Users
{
  "id": "user‑123",
  "role": "driver | company | admin",
  "name": "Jarrett R.",
  "status": "pending‑verification | active | suspended",
  "profile": { "avatar": "...", "brand_color": "#28A4..." }
}

// Jobs (Loads)
{
  "id": "job‑789",
  "posted_by": "company‑456",
  "assigned_to": "driver‑123 | null",
  "origin": "Pooler, GA",
  "destination": "Jacksonville, FL",
  "miles": 140.2,
  "rate": 320.0,
  "priority": "standard | express",
  "status": "open | requested | assigned | picked_up | delivered | paid"
}

2. State Machine (If‑Then Flow)

Current State	Trigger / Actor	Next State	System Actions
open	Driver taps Accept Job	requested	• Lock record for 5 min to stop double‑booking• Notify admin “Driver X requested Job Y”
requested	Admin hits Verify & Assign	assigned	• Check driver docs (insurance_valid == true, etc.)• Attach driver ID to job• Send pickup details to driver• Notify company “Load booked”
requested	Admin hits Decline	open	• Remove driver ID• Message driver with reason (“Insurance expired”)
assigned	Driver taps Picked Up	picked_up	• Timestamp pickup• Open chat thread for real‑time updates
picked_up	Driver taps Delivered	delivered	• Timestamp delivery• Trigger earnings calc
delivered	Admin hits Mark Paid	paid	• Add amount to driver’s Weekly / Monthly totals• Notify driver & company with receipt

(All notifications can be email + SMS via Resend/Twilio webhooks to keep it light.)

3. Page Layout (Driver Dashboard)
	1.	Header – “Welcome, {driverName}” + quick status (Pending Verification / Active).
	2.	Stats Row – Jobs Completed • Rating • Earnings This Week / Month.
	3.	Available Jobs – Filter bar ➜ card list (origin→dest, miles, rate, priority, “Accept Job”).
	4.	Active Jobs – Timeline view with big Picked Up / Delivered buttons.
	5.	Glove Box – Drag‑and‑drop doc area + progress bar (e.g., 87 % Compliance).
	6.	AI Insights – Three cards (Renew Insurance, Submit MVR, Route Training), each with time to finish + benefit tag.
	7.	Performance charts – On‑Time %, Satisfaction, Route Efficiency.
	8.	Quick Links – Find Routes • Track Earnings • Authority Checklist • Grow My Business.
	9.	Message Center – last 5 system or admin notes.

Allow avatar/photo + brand‑color picker in Settings so drivers can theme their dashboard.

4. Company Dashboard Differences
	•	Post a Load modal (origin, destination, miles, rate, required docs, priority).
	•	Load List shows status chips: Open • Driver Requested • Assigned • Delivered.
	•	Billing Tab for invoices & payment history.

5. Lightweight Tech Notes for Replit Build

Concern	Simple Fix
DB	Replit DB tables users, jobs, documents.
Concurrency	Use a 5‑minute TTL “lock” key when job enters requested.
Auth	JWT cookies, one table sessions.
File Uploads	Store to Cloudflare R2 or Supabase Storage; keep only URLs in DB.
Notifications	Resend email API + Twilio SMS; webhooks fire on state changes.
UI	Svelte or React‑lite (Preact) + DaisyUI for quick theming.

6. Quick Evaluation & Tweaks
	1.	Progress Feedback – Add a mini progress bar next to each doc line so drivers see exactly what’s left.
	2.	Single CTA – On every job card only one bright Accept button; other info in a dropdown to avoid clutter.
	3.	Real‑time Updates – Use Pusher or Ably (free tier) so status flips without page refresh.
	4.	Mobile‑First – Card stack layout; large tap targets for on‑the‑road use.
	5.	Social Share – Add “Share badge” link once a driver hits milestones (e.g., 100 Jobs Completed). Generates a pre‑filled LinkedIn/Twitter post.
